Week of Sept 9 – Sept 14, 2025

This week I used AI for both coursework and real-world topics that overlap with information science, finance, and decision-making:

- I asked AI to walk me through a budgeting scenario about “living within my means.” It clarified the 50/30/20 rule and helped me identify which categories belong in a budget. This tied directly into our class conversations about financial literacy and personal data tracking.

- I reviewed short-term financial instruments like money market deposits, along with concepts like enterprise risk management, value chains, and critical success factors. AI broke these down in a way that made them easier to connect to management frameworks.

- I used AI to understand **liquidity and order types** in markets. It explained how limit orders supply liquidity and market orders demand it, and gave me examples I could connect to class discussions about systems and flow of information.

- I practiced **options trading profit calculations** with AI, especially initial margin requirement (IMR) and leverage examples. It gave me sample scenarios that helped me visualize the math and risk side of trading.

- On a more practical note, I asked AI for help drafting a message about disputing damage charges on an apartment lease. It helped me phrase my concerns more professionally so I could advocate for myself while keeping things respectful.

Reflection: This week showed me how flexible AI can be. I used it to reinforce academic topics (finance, management, information flows), to understand market mechanics in detail (liquidity, margin, options), and even for professional communication. As a student, it feels like having both a tutor and a writing coach in one place, as long as I review the output critically.
