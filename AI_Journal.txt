Week of Sept 9 – Sept 14, 2025

This week I used AI for both coursework and real-world topics that overlap with information science, finance, and decision-making:

- I asked AI to walk me through a budgeting scenario about “living within my means.” It clarified the 50/30/20 rule and helped me identify which categories belong in a budget. This tied directly into our class conversations about financial literacy and personal data tracking.

- I reviewed short-term financial instruments like money market deposits, along with concepts like enterprise risk management, value chains, and critical success factors. AI broke these down in a way that made them easier to connect to management frameworks.

- I used AI to understand **liquidity and order types** in markets. It explained how limit orders supply liquidity and market orders demand it, and gave me examples I could connect to class discussions about systems and flow of information.

- I practiced **options trading profit calculations** with AI, especially initial margin requirement (IMR) and leverage examples. It gave me sample scenarios that helped me visualize the math and risk side of trading.

- On a more practical note, I asked AI for help drafting a message about disputing damage charges on an apartment lease. It helped me phrase my concerns more professionally so I could advocate for myself while keeping things respectful.

Reflection: This week showed me how flexible AI can be. I used it to reinforce academic topics (finance, management, information flows), to understand market mechanics in detail (liquidity, margin, options), and even for professional communication. As a student, it feels like having both a tutor and a writing coach in one place, as long as I review the output critically.

- Asked AI for explanations on multiple choice questions about common size statements, net sales, and cost of goods sold.

- Used AI to convert flight times from military/IST to EST in an easy to read format for an upcoming trip.

Reflection: This week I used AI mainly for creative and organizational purposes. It helped me brainstorm and strcuture ideas for the instagram takeover, as well as summarize study materials and clarify concepts in accounting. Having AI assist in multiple areas made tasks more efficient and helped me keep track of progress in both my academic and personal projects. Documenting these interactions helps make it easier to review my learning but also for planning for the future.
