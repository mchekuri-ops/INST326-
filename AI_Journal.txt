Week of Sept 9 – Sept 14, 2025

This week I used AI for both coursework and real-world topics that overlap with information science, finance, and decision-making:

- I asked AI to walk me through a budgeting scenario about “living within my means.” It clarified the 50/30/20 rule and helped me identify which categories belong in a budget. This tied directly into our class conversations about financial literacy and personal data tracking.

- I reviewed short-term financial instruments like money market deposits, along with concepts like enterprise risk management, value chains, and critical success factors. AI broke these down in a way that made them easier to connect to management frameworks.
